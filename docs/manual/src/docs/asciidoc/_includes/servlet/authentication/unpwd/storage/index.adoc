= User Storage

Spring Security's <<servlet-authentication-userdetailsservice,`UserDetailsService`>> allows for storing user information when authenticating with a username/password.
`UserDetailsService` is used by Spring Security when it is configured to <<servlet-authentication-unpwd-input,accept a username/password>> for authentication.

// FIXME: Once it is retrieved it is validated using DaoAuthenticationProvider

* Simple Storage with <<servlet-authentication-inmemory>>
* Relational Databases with <<servlet-authentication-jdbc>>
* LDAP Servers with <<servlet-authentication-ldap>>
