= Authentication

The {security-api-url}org/springframework/security/core/Authentication.html[`Authentication`] is obtained from the <<servlet-authentication-securitycontext>>.
The `Authentication` contains:

* `principal` - identifies the user.
When authenticating with a username/password this is often an instance of `UserDetails`.
* `credentials` - Often a password.
In many cases this will be cleared after the user is authenticated to ensure it is not leaked.
* `authorities` - the <<servlet-authentication-granted-authority,``GrantedAuthority``s>> are high level permissions the user is granted.
A few examples are roles or scopes.
