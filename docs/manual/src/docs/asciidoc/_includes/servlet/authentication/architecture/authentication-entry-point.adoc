= Request Credentials

Sometimes a client will proactively include credentials such as a username/password to request a resource.
In these cases, Spring Security does not need to provide an HTTP response that requests credentials from the client since they are already included.

In other cases, a client will make an unauthenticated request to a resource that they are not authorized to access.
In this case, an implementation of `AuthenticationEntryPoint` is used to request credentials from the client.
The `AuthenticationEntryPoint` implementation might perform a redirect to a log in page, respond with an https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/WWW-Authenticate[WWW-Authenticate] header, etc.
